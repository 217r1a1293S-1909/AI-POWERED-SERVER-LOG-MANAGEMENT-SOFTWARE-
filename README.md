# AI Powered Server Log Management Software

This project is designed to automate the management of server logs using **Python, Machine Learning, and NLP**.  
It helps filter important log information, detect unusual patterns, and provide a simple view of system activity.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- Python
- NLP (Natural Language Processing) for log text processing
- Machine Learning (for anomaly detection in logs)
- Linux Shell Scripts
- Databricks (for data handling)
- Power BI (for dashboard visualization)

## Features
1. Collects and organizes server log data.
2. Uses **NLP** to process log text and identify keywords (errors, warnings, success messages).
3. Applies simple **machine learning models** to detect anomalies or unusual activity in logs.
4. Automates log backup using shell scripts.
5. Provides dashboards for monitoring server performance.

## How It Works
1. Logs are collected from the server.  
2. NLP techniques are applied to clean and tokenize log messages.  
3. Machine learning is used to classify or flag suspicious log entries.  
4. Organized log files and reports are generated.  
5. Dashboards display system performance trends.

## Output
- Organized and filtered log files  
- Error/warning classification  
- Basic anomaly detection reports  
- Dashboard for visualization.
